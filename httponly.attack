Feature: Evaluate received cookies against expected.

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  
   And the following environment variables:
      | name          | environment_variable_name |
      | hostname      | HOSTNAME                  |
      | host          | HOSTNAME                  |

Scenario: Verify server is returning the cookies expected
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl --include --location --head --silent <hostname>
    """
  Then the following cookies should be received:
    | name | httponly |
